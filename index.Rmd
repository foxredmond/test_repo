# Markdown

Markdown is a way to make fancy documents.
Make sure you "Knit" often -- after every major change -- to mitigate errors.
Hashtags are how we make section levels of a doc.

## Next level
### Next level 
#### Fourth level
##### Fifth level

# Basic formatting

This is **bold.** (that's double asterisks). Or *italics*. Or `code`.

- this is the start of a list. 
- next item. 
- next item. make sure to have space at end of item.

1. this is a numbered list. 
2. second item. 

To add a hyperlink, do `[link text](url)`. without backticks.
For example, [go here](https://sewanee.edu)

To link to sections of your document, do `[link text](#section-name)`, without backticks, hyphens for spaces, and only lowercase.  For example, [go here](#markdown). 

To add more vertical space between blocks of text, use this: "&nbsp;" without quotes.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Should be more space now.

**To include an image inside the folder where your `Rmd` file is located.
Then type `![]full_image_filname_here){width = "50"}`
![](../images/IMG_5247.jpeg){width="50%"}


# RMarkdown

`RMarkdown` is just `Markdown` with `R` code woven in.

You can do R stuff in the same line as text. For example. `r 3+3` will show as 6.
(It would look like bactick lower-case-r space then code then backtick).

You can also do a full-multi-line CHUNK of R stuff:

```{r chunk-name }
# ```{r}
3+3
# ```
```

Settings to control how R chunks appear:

- `eval = TRUE`: which actually runs the code; if `FALSE`, it shows the code but doesn't run it.
- `echoe = TRUE`: which shows the code; if `FALSE`, the code can run without being seen.
- `warnings = FALSE`: which will turn off warnings.

-`fig.cap = "figure caption"` adds a figure caption.

-`fig.width = 7` example of figure width.

-`fig.height = 4` example of figure height.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# this will be shown but not evaluated
3+3
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# this will be evaluated but not shown
4+4
```


# Bringing in real data

To manually set working directory while building up my Rmarkdown file, just go to Sessions > Set working directory > Source file location.

```{r read data, }
library(readr)
energy <- read_csv("../data/IRENA data.csv", skip = 1)
```

```{r explore data, }
library(dplyr)
energy %>% names
energy %>% head
energy %>% tail
energy %>% pull(Technology) %>% unique %>% sort
```

```{r}
# filtered data
 fenergy <- 
  energy %>% 
  filter(`Country/area` == 'United States of America (the)')
```

```{r}
  library(ggplot2)
  library(plotly)
  p <- ggplot(fenergy, 
         aes(x=Year,
             y=as.numeric(`Electricity statistics`),
             fill=Technology)) +
    geom_area() 
   
  ggplotly(p)

```
